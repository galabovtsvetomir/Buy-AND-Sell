## Introduction
The Restaurant Management System (RMS) is a software application designed to streamline various operations within a restaurant, including managing employees, handling orders, tracking inventory, and generating reports. This README provides an overview of the system's architecture, features, and usage instructions.

## System Overview
The RMS is built to address the needs of restaurant owners, managers, chefs, waiters, and other staff involved in day-to-day operations. It offers a user-friendly interface for managing various aspects of the restaurant efficiently.

## Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture, consisting of multiple components:

1. **Database**: Stores information about employees, orders, customers, menu items, and inventory. SQLite is used as the default database management system.

2. **Model Layer**: Contains classes representing different entities in the system, such as employees, orders, meals, and ingredients.

3. **Controller Layer**: Handles the business logic of the application, including CRUD operations, data validation, and business rules enforcement.

4. **View Layer**: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the system. It includes screens for login, employee management, order processing, inventory management, and reporting.

5. **Constants**: Contains constant values used throughout the application, such as default field values, error messages, and configuration settings.

6. **Utilities**: Includes helper functions and classes used across different parts of the system, such as password hashing, email generation, and currency formatting.

## Features
The RMS offers the following features:

1. **User Authentication**: Secure login functionality for employees with role-based access control.

2. **Employee Management**: CRUD operations for adding, updating, and deleting employee records. Different employee types include chefs, waiters, managers, and administrators.

3. **Order Processing**: Creation, modification, and fulfillment of customer orders. Integration with the kitchen for meal preparation and delivery.

4. **Inventory Management**: Tracking and updating inventory levels for ingredients and menu items. Automated alerts for low stock levels.

5. **Reporting**: Generation of sales reports, inventory reports, employee performance reports, and other custom reports based on user-defined criteria.
